        <h2><u>2: Implication (→)</u></h2>
        <p>In the syntax of propositional logic, the <b>implies</b> connective is represented by the symbol <b>→</b>.</p>
        <p>The meaning of this symbol can be understood like so: in A → B, the presence of A suggests the presence of B.</p>
        <p>For example, when there are rainclouds in the sky (A), rain usually follows (B).</p>
        <br />
        <p>Implication can be introduced in a proof with <b>implication introduction</b> - <b>[→I]</b>.</p>
        <p>Implication can be be removed from a proof with <b>implication elimination</b> - <b>[→E]</b>.</p>

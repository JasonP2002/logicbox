        <h2><u>3: Or (∨)</u></h2>
        <p>In the syntax of propositional logic, the <b>or</b> connective is represented by the symbol <b>∨</b>.</p>
        <p>The meaning of this symbol can be understood like so: in A ∨ B, we have a proof of A or B.</p>
        <p>For example, if we have a proof of "Learning logic is fun", we can come to the conclusion that "Learning logic is fun <b>or</b> Learning logic is tricky".</p>
        <br />
        <p>Or can be introduced in a proof via two rules, , <b>or introduction left/right</b> - <b>[∨Il]</b>/<b>[∨Ir]</b>.</p>
        <p>Or and connective can be removed from a proof with <b>or elimination</b> - <b>[∨El]</b>.</p>

        <h2><u>1: And (∧)</u></h2>
        <p>In the syntax of propositional logic, the <b>and</b> connective is represented by the symbol <b>∧</b>.</p>
        <p>The meaning of this symbol can be understood like so: in A ∧ B, we have both of both A and B.</p>
        <p>For example, if we have a proof that "Learning logic is fun", and we have a proof that "And Introduction is fun", then we can come to the conclusion that "Learning logic is fun <b>and</b> And Introduction is fun".</p>
        <br />
        <p>And can be introduced into a proof with <b>and introduction</b> - <b>[∧I]</b>.</p>
        <p>The and connective can be removed from a proof with two rules, <b>and elimination left/right</b> - <b>[∧El]</b>/<b>[∧Er]</b>. The use of this depends on if we wish to use the statement on the left or the right side of the connective.</p>
